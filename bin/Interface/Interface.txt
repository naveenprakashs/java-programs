  Interface cannot have Objects

  Each class that implements an interface must implement all of the methods of the interface

  Variables can be declared inside interface.They are implicitly final and static.
  They must be initialized. we can't assign value to variables in another class.

  The methods that implements Interface must be declared as public.

  Interface variable can reference the object of a class which implement the interface.
  It is similar as superclass variable can reference subclass object.
  
  Partial Implementations:
  If a class includes an interface but does not fully implement the methods required by that
  interface, then that class must be declared as abstract.but the chiled class of that class must implement all of 
  the methods of interface
  
  Nested interfaces:
  An interface can be declared a member of a class or another interface. Such an interface
  is called a member interface or a nested interface.
  
  Variables in Interfaces:
  
  Inheriting Interfaces:
  one interface can inherit another interface.
  
  Default methods or extension methods:
  
  
  problem of having default methods:
